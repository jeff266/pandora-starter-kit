Key Tests in Replit:                                 
                                                       
  1. Server Startup ✓                                  
                                                       
  npm run dev                                          
  - Should start without import/syntax errors          
  - Check for any initialization errors in logs        
                                                       
  2. Connector Operations (Most Critical)              
                                                       
  Test with an existing connected workspace:           
  - Health checks: GET                                 
  /api/workspaces/:id/connectors/hubspot/health        
  - Sync operations: POST                              
  /api/workspaces/:id/connectors/hubspot/sync          
  - Connect flow: Try connecting a new connector       
  - Test Gong, Fireflies, Salesforce if you have them  
  configured                                           
                                                       
  3. Enrichment Config                                 
                                                       
  - GET /api/workspaces/:id/config/enrichment - Should 
  return boolean indicators                            
  - PUT /api/workspaces/:id/config/enrichment - Try    
  updating an API key                                  
                                                       
  4. Token Refresh (If Salesforce is configured)       
                                                       
  - Trigger a Salesforce sync                          
  - Verify token refresh works if credentials are      
  expired                                              
                                                       
  5. Encryption Test Suite                             
                                                       
  CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-key npx tsx           
  server/scripts/test-encryption.ts                    
  Should show: Tests Complete: 15 passed, 0 failed     
                                                       
  What to Watch For:                                   
                                                       
  ❌ Red flags:                                        
  - Import errors on startup                           
  - 500 errors on health checks                        
  - "credentials not found" errors                     
  - Type errors in logs                                
                                                       
  ✅ Good signs:                                       
  - Server starts cleanly                              
  - Existing connections show "connected/healthy"      
  - Sync operations complete successfully              
  - Enrichment config returns properly                 
                                                       
  If anything breaks, the error messages should be     
  clear about which file/function has issues, and we   
  can fix it quickly. The changes are isolated to      
  credential access patterns, so any issues will       
  surface immediately in connector operations.
