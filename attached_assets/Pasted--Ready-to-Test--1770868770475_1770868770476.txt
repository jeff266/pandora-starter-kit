🧪 Ready to Test!                                                        
                                                                           
  Open SALESFORCE_PROMPT_1_TEST_PLAN.md and start testing:                 
                                                                           
  Test 1: OAuth Authorization Flow                                         
                                                                           
  1. Get your Replit URL:                                                  
  https://<your-app>.replit.app                                            
  2. Get a test workspace ID:                                              
  SELECT id, name FROM workspaces LIMIT 1;                                 
  3. Trigger OAuth:                                                        
  https://<your-app>.replit.app/api/auth/salesforce/authorize?workspaceId=<
  workspace-id>                                                            
  4. Expected:                                                             
    - Redirects to login.salesforce.com (NOT test.salesforce.com)          
    - URL has all OAuth params (client_id, redirect_uri, scope, state)     
    - State is base64-encoded with HMAC signature                          
  5. Log in to your first Salesforce production org                        
  6. After granting permissions:                                           
    - Redirects back to your app                                           
    - Should see ?workspace=<id>&connected=salesforce in URL               
  7. Verify credentials stored:                                            
  SELECT                                                                   
    workspace_id,                                                          
    connector_name,                                                        
    status,                                                                
    credentials->>'org_id' as org_id,                                      
    credentials->>'instance_url' as instance_url,                          
    credentials->>'connected_by' as connected_by                           
  FROM connector_configs                                                   
  WHERE connector_name = 'salesforce';                                     
                                                                           
  Expected result:                                                         
  - status = 'connected'                                                   
  - org_id is a 15-char Salesforce ID                                      
  - instance_url is an HTTPS URL                                           
  - connected_by is your email

  If Test 1 passes, continue to Test 5: Connection Test Endpoint to verify 
  the connection works:                                                    
                                                                           
  curl -X POST https://<your-app>.replit.app/api/workspaces/<workspace-id>/
  connectors/salesforce/test                                               
                                                                           
  Expected:                                                                
  {                                                                        
    "success": true,

  Then move to Test 7: Initial Sync to populate data!
