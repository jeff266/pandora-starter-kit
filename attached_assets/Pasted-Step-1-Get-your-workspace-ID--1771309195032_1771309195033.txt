Step 1 — Get your workspace ID                         
                                                         
  In Replit, open the Shell tab and run:                 
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces \         
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" | jq         
  '.[0].id'                                              
  Or grab it from the URL in the browser — it's the UUID 
  in /workspaces/<uuid>/...                              
                                                         
  ---                                                    
  Step 2 — Run the backfill (start with 20)              
                                                         
  curl -s -X POST \                                      
    http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces/<workspace-id>/c
  onnectors/gong/backfill-transcripts \                  
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \                
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \            
    -d '{"limit": 20}' | jq                              
                                                         
  You'll get back:                                       
  {                                                      
    "processed": 20,                                     
    "updated": 17,                                       
    "no_transcript_available": 3,                        
    "errors": []                                         
  }                                                      
                                                         
  no_transcript_available means those calls exist in Gong
   but Gong hasn't generated a transcript (short calls,  
  no recording, etc.) — that's normal.                   
                                                         
  ---                                                    
  Step 3 — Run again to get more                         
                                                         
  Each call updates the most recent calls first. Run it  
  again with a higher limit or repeat until updated: 0:  
  # Get all remaining (up to 100)                        
  curl -s -X POST \                                      
    http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces/<workspace-id>/c
  onnectors/gong/backfill-transcripts \                  
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \                
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \            
    -d '{"limit": 100}' | jq                             
                                                         
  Signal extraction fires automatically ~2 seconds after 
  each backfill run, so by the time you ask "What are the
   most common objections?" the calls will be analyzed.
