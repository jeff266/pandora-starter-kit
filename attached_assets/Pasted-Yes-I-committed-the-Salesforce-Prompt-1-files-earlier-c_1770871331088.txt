Yes, I committed the Salesforce Prompt 1 files earlier (commit 7cf0608): 
  - SALESFORCE_PROMPT_1_REPLIT.md                                          
  - SALESFORCE_PROMPT_1_TEST_PLAN.md                                       
                                                                           
  You already pulled them with git pull origin main.                       
                                                                           
  Since then, there's been no new code to commit - all the work has been:  
  1. Replit implementing the OAuth + sync routes (on Replit, not pushed to 
  your local)                                                              
  2. You testing on Replit (verification, not code changes)                
                                                                           
  ---                                                                      
  What's Where:

  ---                                                                      
  Should Replit commit and push?                                           
                                                                           
  Yes! Once you finish the multi-tenant test (Option A), have Replit:      
                                                                           
  1. Commit the Salesforce integration:                                    
  git add server/routes/salesforce-auth.ts server/routes/salesforce-sync.ts
   server/sync/orchestrator.ts                                             
  git commit -m "Add Salesforce OAuth and sync integration (Prompt 1)      
                                                                           
  - OAuth flow with HMAC-signed state and replay protection                
  - Connector API routes: test, sync, discover-schema, health, disconnect  
  - Orchestrator integration with explicit status allowlist                
  - Initial and incremental sync working                                   
  - Tested with Imubit production org (11,190 records in 19s)

  git push origin main                                                     
                                                                           
  2. Then you can pull those changes locally to have the full Salesforce   
  implementation.

  Want to finish the multi-tenant test first, then commit? Or commit now?
