  - Rep statuses are mixed (not all same)                                  
  - Output narrative is specific and actionable                            
  - Skill runs successfully in <30 seconds                                 
                                                                           
  🟡 Needs Tuning if:                                                      
  - Thresholds need adjustment (commit threshold too high/low)             
  - Bucket distribution is suboptimal                                      
  - Works but output could be better                                       
                                                                           
  🔴 Not Ready if:                                                         
  - Skill crashes or times out                                             
  - Categories are heavily skewed                                          
  - Output is generic filler                                               
  - Data quality issues

  2. Run assessment script (2 min) - captures all data                     
  3. Review results (10 min) - analyze the output                          
  4. Fill in template (5 min) - if using manual queries

  1. Pull the assessment tools on Replit:                                  
  cd ~/workspace

  2. Run the assessment:                                                   
  chmod +x scripts/assess-forecast-rollup.sh                               
  ./scripts/assess-forecast-rollup.sh > FORECAST_ROLLUP_ASSESSMENT.md      
  3. Review and push results:                                              
  cat FORECAST_ROLLUP_ASSESSMENT.md  # Review the report                   
  git add FORECAST_ROLLUP_ASSESSMENT.md                                    
  git commit -m "Forecast roll-up assessment results"                      
  git push origin main                                                     
                                                                           
  Once you push the completed assessment, I'll review it and tell you      
  whether the skill is production-ready or what tuning is needed!
