I'm debugging the ICP Taxonomy Builder skill. The skill shows
   as "completed" (22.9s, green checkmark) in the UI at        
  /skills, but no data is being written to the database.       
                                                               
  SYMPTOMS:                                                    
  - Skill run shows: "Last run: 1m ago · 22.9s · ✅ completed" 
  - Run ID in UI: c85f150e (truncated)                         
  - Query `SELECT * FROM icp_taxonomy WHERE workspace_id =     
  (SELECT id FROM workspaces WHERE name = 'Frontera')` returns 
  0 rows                                                       
  - Query `SELECT * FROM skill_runs WHERE skill_id =           
  'icp-taxonomy-builder' AND workspace_id = (SELECT id FROM    
  workspaces WHERE name = 'Frontera')` returns 0 rows          
                                                               
  RELEVANT FILES:                                              
  1. /server/skills/library/icp-taxonomy-builder.ts (skill     
  definition)                                                  
  2. /server/skills/compute/icp-taxonomy.ts (compute functions 
  including persistTaxonomy)                                   
  3. /server/routes/skills.ts (POST                            
  /:workspaceId/skills/:skillId/run endpoint)                  
  4. /server/skills/runtime.ts (skill execution logic)         
                                                               
  QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:                                    
  1. What workspace ID is the skill actually running against?  
  Check the POST request to /skills/icp-taxonomy-builder/run - 
  does it include a workspaceId in the body?                   
                                                               
  2. Check the skill_runs table without workspace filter:      
  `SELECT workspace_id, run_id, status, error, created_at FROM 
  skill_runs WHERE skill_id = 'icp-taxonomy-builder' ORDER BY  
  created_at DESC LIMIT 3`                                     
                                                               
  3. In /server/routes/skills.ts line 111-126, the POST        
  /skills/:skillId/run endpoint - where does it get the        
  workspaceId from? Is it from req.body.workspaceId or from    
  req.workspace?                                               
                                                               
  4. In /server/skills/runtime.ts, look at the executeSkill    
  method - does it pass workspaceId correctly to all compute   
  functions?                                                   
                                                               
  5. In /server/skills/compute/icp-taxonomy.ts line 277-372    
  (persistTaxonomy function) - add console.log statements to   
  verify:                                                      
     - What workspaceId is being passed                        
     - Whether stepData contains the expected data             
     - Whether the INSERT query actually executes              
     - What error (if any) is thrown                           
                                                               
  6. Check server logs for any errors or warnings during the   
  skill run. Look for "[ICPTaxonomy]" log messages.            
                                                               
  EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:                                           
  The persistTaxonomy function should write a row to           
  icp_taxonomy table with the taxonomy report, classifications,
   and metadata.                                               
                                                               
  Please help me find why the skill completes successfully but 
  writes no data.                                              
                                                               
  This prompt gives Replit all the context needed to trace     
  through the execution flow and identify where the data is    
  getting lost.
