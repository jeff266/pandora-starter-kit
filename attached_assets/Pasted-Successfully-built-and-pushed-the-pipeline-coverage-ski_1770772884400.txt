Successfully built and pushed the pipeline-coverage skill. Here's 
  what was implemented:                                             
                                                                    
  Architecture                                                      
                                                                    
  9-step pipeline following the exact pattern from pipeline-hygiene 
  and data-quality-audit:                                           
                                                                    
  1. resolve-time-windows (COMPUTE) - Resolve quarter dates and time
   ranges                                                           
  2. check-quota-config (COMPUTE) - Read quotas from context layer  
  3. gather-coverage-data (COMPUTE) - SQL-first coverage calculation
   by rep                                                           
  4. gather-coverage-trend (COMPUTE) - Compare vs previous run      
  5. gather-rep-pipeline-quality (COMPUTE) - Analyze early vs late  
  stage distribution                                                
  6. prepare-at-risk-reps (COMPUTE) - Filter and cap at-risk reps to
   10 max                                                           
  7. classify-rep-risk (DEEPSEEK) - Classify root causes            
  (insufficient_prospecting, poor_conversion, deal_slippage,        
  quota_mismatch, ramping, pipeline_quality)                        
  8. calculate-output-budget (COMPUTE) - Dynamic word budgets       
  9. synthesize-coverage-report (CLAUDE) - Strategic synthesis with 
  specific rep actions                                              
                                                                    
  Key Features                                                      
                                                                    
  SQL-first aggregation:                                            
  - All coverage calculations in PostgreSQL using FILTER clauses    
  - No loading deals into memory                                    
  - Handles NULL forecast_category (treats as pipeline)             
  - Groups NULL owner as "Unassigned"                               
                                                                    
  Graceful degradation:                                             
  - Works without quotas configured                                 
  - Shows absolute pipeline numbers with note: "⚠️ Configure quotas 
  for coverage analysis"                                            
  - Falls back to revenue_target if quotas.team not set             
                                                                    
  Intelligent filtering:                                            
  - Only sends at-risk/behind reps to DeepSeek (max 10)             
  - Skips DeepSeek entirely if all reps on track                    
  - Includes quality flags and trend data in classification         
                                                                    
  Rep status logic:                                                 
  - on_track: coverage ≥ target (3.0x default)                      
  - at_risk: coverage ≥ 60% of target                               
  - behind: coverage < 60% of target                                
  - unknown: no quota configured

  summarizeForClaude now handles both:                              
  - data-quality-audit (entity summaries)                           
  - pipeline-coverage (team summary, rep table, quality flags,      
  trend, risk classifications)

  Expected output:                                                  
  - Team headline: on track / at risk / behind verdict              
  - Coverage gap: $ needed, weekly run rate required                
  - At-risk reps: specific actions per rep                          
  - Pipeline quality concerns: reps with >70% early-stage pipeline  
  - Top 3 actions ranked by revenue impact
