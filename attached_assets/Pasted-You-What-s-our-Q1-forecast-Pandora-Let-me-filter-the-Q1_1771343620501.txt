What's our Q1 forecast?
Pandora
Let me filter the Q1 deals and calculate the probability-weighted forecast manually based on the data I have:
## Q1 2026 Forecast
Raw Pipeline Total: $1,446,430 across 49 open deals closing in Q1 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026)
### Probability-Weighted Forecast Breakdown:
By Forecast Category:
• Best Case (3 deals): $11,940 raw → ~$9,552 weighted (80% probability)
  - Beyou Behavior Therapy SPC - $8,100 (Contract Sent)
  - Guidepost ABA - $1,620 (Contract Sent)
  - Snowflakes ABA - $1,620 (Contract Sent)
• Pipeline (37 deals): $762,490 raw → ~$228,747 weighted (avg 30% probability)
• Fellowship Deals - Closed Won (8 deals): $672,000 raw → $672,000 weighted (100% probability)
  - These are marked as "Fellow Contract Signed (Closed-Won)" but still showing as open
  - All owned by Sara Bollman (3) and Nate Phillips (5)
• Other/Null Category (1 partnership deal): $7,200
Estimated Probability-Weighted Total: ~$910,000 - $950,000
### Top Deals by Amount:
1. ACES ABA - $240K (Pilot, closes 2/13) - Nate Phillips
2. Action Behavior Centers - $150K (Proposal Reviewed, closes 3/31) - Nate Phillips
3. Catalight - $96K (Pilot, closes 3/1) - Nate Phillips
4. Fellowship Deals - 8 deals × $84K = $672K (Contract Signed, various close dates in Jan-Feb)
5. Cultivate Behavioral Health - $48.6K (Demo Conducted, closes 3/31) - Nate Phillips
### Key Observations:
• Fellowship Pipeline dominates: $672K (46% of raw pipeline) is already at 100% probability
• Core Sales Pipeline: $762K spread across 37 deals in various stages
• Late-stage deals: Only 3 deals in Contract Sent stage ($11.9K total)
• Risk: Many deals closing 3/31 (end of quarter) may slip to Q2
The forecast rollup skill didn't return recent data, but based on the deal pipeline, your realistic Q1 forecast is approximately $910K-$950K when probability-weighted.
