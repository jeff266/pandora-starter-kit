The sync orchestrator (server/sync/orchestrator.ts) is already built and working. 
Build the three remaining pieces:

1. server/sync/scheduler.ts

Install node-cron package.

Create a SyncScheduler class:
- start(): registers a cron job at "0 2 * * *" (2 AM UTC daily)
- stop(): cancels the cron job
- The job:
  a. Query all workspaces that have at least one row in connector_configs with status = 'connected'
  b. For each workspace, call the sync orchestrator's syncWorkspace() 
  c. Run workspaces SEQUENTIALLY (not parallel) to avoid hammering external APIs
  d. Log start/end for each workspace: "[Scheduler] Syncing workspace {name} ({id})..."
  e. Log summary when done: "[Scheduler] Daily sync complete: {N} workspaces, {duration}ms"
  f. Catch errors per workspace — one failure doesn't stop the others

Initialize the scheduler in server/index.ts on startup. Log: "[Scheduler] Daily sync scheduled for 2:00 AM UTC"

2. server/sync/backfill.ts

HubSpot-specific association backfill:
- backfillHubSpotAssociations(workspaceId: string): Promise<BackfillResult>
- Gets HubSpot credentials from connector_configs
- For each deal in the deals table (where source = 'hubspot'):
  a. Fetch associations from HubSpot API: GET /crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}/associations/contacts
  b. Fetch associations: GET /crm/v3/objects/deals/{dealId}/associations/companies
  c. Match contact source_ids to our contacts table → update deal's contact associations
  d. Match company source_ids to our accounts table → update deal's account_id
- Batch the API calls (don't fetch one deal at a time — use HubSpot batch read endpoint if available)
- Log: "[Backfill] Updated associations for {N} deals in workspace {id}"
- Return: { dealsProcessed, contactLinksCreated, accountLinksCreated, errors }

Wire into the scheduler: after incremental sync, if connector_type = 'hubspot' 
and connector_configs.metadata has { usedExportApi: true }, run backfill.

3. server/routes/sync.ts

Three endpoints:

POST /api/workspaces/:id/sync
- Trigger manual sync for the workspace
- Run async (return 202 Accepted immediately, sync runs in background)
- Response: { syncId, status: "started", message: "Sync initiated for {N} connectors" }
- Optional body: { connectorType?: string } to sync just one connector

GET /api/workspaces/:id/sync/status
- Query connector_configs for the workspace
- For each connected connector: name, status, last_sync_at, last_error
- Also check if a sync is currently running (check sync_log for status = 'running')
- Response: { isRunning, connectors: [...], lastFullSync }

GET /api/workspaces/:id/sync/history
- Query sync_log table for this workspace
- Default: last 20 entries, ordered by started_at desc
- Query params: ?limit=20&connector=hubspot
- Response: { entries: [{ id, connector_type, sync_type, status, records_synced, duration_ms, started_at, completed_at, errors }] }

Register these routes in server/index.ts.
