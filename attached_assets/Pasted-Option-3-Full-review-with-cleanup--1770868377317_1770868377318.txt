Option 3: Full review with cleanup                                       
                                                                           
  Have Replit:                                                             
                                                                           
  1. Read the full SALESFORCE_PROMPT_1_REPLIT.md file (it's in the repo now
   after you pulled)                                                       
  2. Do a cleanup pass first (critical security fix):                      
    - Remove the unreachable code at lines 178-188 in the OAuth callback   
    - Fix the token leaking issue                                          
    - Align the status check: orchestrator should include 'healthy' along  
  with 'connected' (match the pattern: WHERE status IN ('connected',       
  'healthy'))                                                              
  3. Cross-reference all 7 tasks against the prompt:                       
    - Task 1: Environment variables (✓ but verify they're documented)      
    - Task 2: OAuth routes - /authorize and /callback (✓ but need cleanup) 
    - Task 3: Connector API routes - test, sync, discover-schema, health,  
  disconnect (verify all 5 exist)                                          
    - Task 4: Sync orchestrator wiring (verify status check includes       
  'healthy')                                                               
    - Task 5: Nightly sync schedule (verify Salesforce included alongside  
  HubSpot)                                                                 
    - Task 6: Route registration in server/index.ts (verify both auth and  
  sync routes registered)                                                  
    - Task 7: Adapter registration (verify salesforceAdapter is registered 
  in registry)                                                             
  4. Verify compilation - make sure everything compiles with no TypeScript 
  errors                                                                   
  5. Report back what was fixed and if anything was missing                
                                                                           
  ---                                                                      
  This ensures both the security issue is fixed AND we have confidence that
   the implementation matches the spec before testing
