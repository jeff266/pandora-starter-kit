ONBOARDING VALIDATION — FRONTERA HEALTH

Frontera Health has HubSpot (385 deals, 3,988 contacts, 1,689 
accounts) and Gong (22 conversations, 20 linked) connected. 
Run the full post-setup skill sequence and time every step. 
This is the "new customer experience" validation.

The goal: measure how long it takes from "data synced" to 
"first actionable insights in Slack." Every step gets timed. 
Every failure gets logged. Do NOT fix anything — just log it.

---

STEP 1: VERIFY DATA FOUNDATION

Run these checks and log results:

a. Confirm sync is current:
   SELECT connector_type, status, last_sync_at, 
     (metadata->>'record_count')::int as records
   FROM connector_configs 
   WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_workspace_id>';

b. Check entity counts:
   SELECT 'deals' as entity, COUNT(*) as total,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE stage_normalized NOT IN ('closed_won', 'closed_lost')) as open,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE stage_normalized = 'closed_won') as won,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE stage_normalized = 'closed_lost') as lost
   FROM deals WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>'
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'contacts', COUNT(*), NULL, NULL, NULL
   FROM contacts WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>'
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'accounts', COUNT(*), NULL, NULL, NULL
   FROM accounts WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>'
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'activities', COUNT(*), NULL, NULL, NULL
   FROM activities WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>'
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'conversations', COUNT(*),
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE account_id IS NOT NULL), 
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deal_id IS NOT NULL), NULL
   FROM conversations WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>';

c. Check computed fields ran:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE days_in_stage IS NOT NULL) as has_days_in_stage,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE pipeline_velocity IS NOT NULL) as has_velocity,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE engagement_score IS NOT NULL) as has_engagement
   FROM deals WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>';

   If computed fields are NULL, trigger them:
   POST /api/workspaces/<frontera_id>/computed-fields/refresh

d. Check deal_contacts:
   SELECT COUNT(*) as contact_roles,
     COUNT(DISTINCT buying_role) as unique_roles
   FROM deal_contacts WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>';

   If zero, that's expected for HubSpot (no OpportunityContactRole 
   equivalent unless associations were synced). Log this — it affects 
   Single-Thread Alert and Lead Scoring threading scores.

e. Check custom_fields population:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (
     WHERE custom_fields IS NOT NULL 
       AND custom_fields != '{}' 
       AND custom_fields::text != 'null'
   ) as deals_with_custom_fields
   FROM deals WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>';

   Also check what keys exist:
   SELECT DISTINCT jsonb_object_keys(custom_fields) as key
   FROM deals 
   WHERE workspace_id = '<frontera_id>' 
     AND custom_fields IS NOT NULL AND custom_fields != '{}'
   LIMIT 30;

Log ALL results. This is the "data readiness checklist."

---

STEP 2: RUN CUSTOM FIELD DISCOVERY

Time this step.

POST /api/workspaces/<frontera_id>/skills/custom-field-discovery/run

Log:
- How many fields scanned per entity type
- How many passed filter
- Top 5 fields by score with their stats
- Whether lead data exists (Frontera is HubSpot — leads are 
  contacts with lifecycle stages, not a separate object)
- Total execution time

If custom_fields is empty or discovery returns zero candidates, 
log that and note: "Custom field discovery found no fields. 
Check if HubSpot transform populates custom_fields JSONB."

---

STEP 3: RUN ALL 9 TIER 1 SKILLS

Run each skill sequentially. Time each one. Log status, duration, 
and a one-line summary of the key finding.

Run in this order:
1. pipeline-hygiene
2. single-thread-alert
3. data-quality-audit
4. pipeline-coverage
5. pipeline-waterfall
6. rep-scorecard
7. deal-risk-review
8. weekly-recap
9. forecast-rollup

For each skill log:
- Skill ID
- Status: PASS or FAIL
- Duration in seconds
- Token usage (Claude + DeepSeek)
- One-line key finding from the output
- Any errors, empty sections, or "no data" messages
- Did it produce real Frontera deal names and amounts?
- Did conversation data enhance the output? (Single-Thread 
  Alert and Deal Risk Review should reference Gong calls 
  if conversations are linked to deals)

CRITICAL: If any skill fails or produces empty/generic output, 
log the full error message. Don't skip it.

---

STEP 4: RUN ICP DISCOVERY

Time this step.

POST /api/workspaces/<frontera_id>/skills/icp-discovery/run

Log:
- Number of closed deals analyzed (won + lost)
- Persona patterns found (if any — depends on deal_contacts)
- Company sweet spot findings
- Custom field discoveries
- Conversation intelligence section (did Gong data add anything?
  Frontera has 12 deals linked to Gong calls)
- Full execution time
- If Frontera has fewer than 30 closed deals with outcomes, 
  log the data readiness assessment

---

STEP 5: RUN LEAD SCORING

Time this step.

POST /api/workspaces/<frontera_id>/skills/lead-scoring/run

Log:
- Total entities scored (deals + contacts)
- Grade distribution (A/B/C/D/F counts)
- Scoring method used (point_based or icp_point_based)
- Top 3 deals with scores and grades
- Custom field contribution (did discovery fields add points?)
- Conversation features contribution (Frontera HAS Gong — did 
  has_calls, recent_call score for linked deals?)
- Full execution time

---

STEP 6: GENERATE ONBOARDING REPORT

After all steps complete, compile this exact report format:

# Onboarding Report — Frontera Health
# Generated: <timestamp>

## Data Foundation
- CRM: HubSpot (connected <date>)
- Conversations: Gong (<N> calls, <N> linked to deals)
- Deals: <total> (open: <N>, won: <N>, lost: <N>)
- Contacts: <N>
- Accounts: <N>
- Activities: <N>
- Contact Roles: <N> (or "0 — HubSpot limitation")
- Custom Fields: <N> keys found on deals
- Computed Fields: <populated or missing>

## Custom Field Discovery
- Fields scanned: <N>
- Passed filter: <N>
- Top fields: <list top 3 with scores>
- Execution time: <N>s

## ICP Discovery
- Closed deals analyzed: <N>
- Status: PASS/FAIL
- Duration: <N>s
- Key findings: <summary>
- Conversation intelligence: <used/not available>

## Lead Scoring
- Entities scored: <N> deals + <N> contacts
- Method: <point_based or icp_point_based>
- Grade distribution: A=<N> B=<N> C=<N> D=<N> F=<N>

## Timing Summary
| Step | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Data verification | Xs |
| Custom field discovery | Xs |
| 9 Tier 1 skills (total) | Xs |
| ICP Discovery | Xs |
| Lead Scoring | Xs |
| **TOTAL** | **Xs** |

## Issues Found
List every failure, error, empty output, or degraded quality:
1. <skill>: <issue description>
2. ...

## Comparison Notes (vs Imubit)
- Imubit: Salesforce, 621 deals, no conversations, 1,193 contact roles
- Frontera: HubSpot, 385 deals, 22 Gong conversations, <N> contact roles
- Key differences observed: ...

## HubSpot-Specific Observations
Note anything that behaved differently on HubSpot vs Salesforce:
- Stage normalization differences
- Custom field naming patterns
- Activity type handling
- Contact role availability
- Any field that was populated for Imubit but empty for Frontera

---

DO NOT:
- Fix any bugs during this run — just log them
- Skip any skill even if you think it will fail
- Modify Frontera's data
- Run syncs (data should already be current)
- Post to Slack (just capture output locally)

This is a read-only validation pass. Every issue found becomes 
a fix list for Claude Code in the next session.
