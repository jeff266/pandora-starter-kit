Build the Actions page — this is where users approve or reject 
actions that agents recommend.

Read:
- server/actions/ — existing actions service and types
- server/agents/playbook-executor.ts — the action handlers 
  (notify_rep, update_deal_stage, create_follow_up_task, 
  update_contact_field)
- The existing Actions nav item in the sidebar

The Actions page shows pending actions that need human approval.

Layout:

FILTER BAR:
- Status tabs: Pending (default), Executed, Failed, All
- Filter by: agent, action type, severity
- Sort by: created_at desc

ACTION CARDS (each pending action):
- Header: action type as readable label + severity badge
- Entity: deal/account/contact name (linked to detail page)
- Summary: what the agent wants to do and why
- Evidence: the finding that triggered this action
- Impact: dollar amount if available
- Agent attribution: which agent recommended this

ACTION BUTTONS (for pending status):
- "Approve & Execute" (green) — calls the playbook executor 
  to fire the action (CRM write, Slack DM, etc). On success, 
  card moves to Executed with timestamp.
- "Reject" (red outline) — sets status to rejected with 
  optional reason input. Card moves to rejected state.
- "Snooze" — delays action for 1d/3d/7d

EXECUTED STATE:
- Shows green checkmark, executed_at timestamp, executed_by
- If CRM write: shows "Updated in HubSpot/Salesforce" with 
  link to CRM record
- Shows crm_write_log entry if available

FAILED STATE:
- Shows error message
- "Retry" button

API:
- GET /api/workspaces/:id/actions?status=pending
- PATCH /api/workspaces/:id/actions/:actionId 
  Body: { status: 'approved' } or { status: 'rejected', reason }
- POST /api/workspaces/:id/actions/:actionId/execute
  Calls the playbook executor handler for this action type
  Returns execution result

Wire the sidebar Actions badge to show count of pending actions.

via playbook, verify actions appear on the page, approve one.
