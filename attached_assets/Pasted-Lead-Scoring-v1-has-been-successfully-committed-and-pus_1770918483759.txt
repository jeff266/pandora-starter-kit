  Lead Scoring v1 - A point-based scoring system that works immediately    
  with your existing data:                                                 
                                                                           
  Core Scoring Engine (server/skills/compute/lead-scoring.ts - ~1100 lines)
                                                                           
  - Feature extraction from open deals and contacts with engagement,       
  threading, velocity, and conversation signals                            
  - Point-based scoring algorithm with default weights that work           
  generically                                                              
  - Dynamic custom field integration - loads weights from discovery results
   and applies them automatically                                          
  - Score persistence with change tracking to identify movers              
  - Workspace normalization for amount-based scoring

  Three-phase execution pattern:                                           
  1. Compute phase: scoreLeads function extracts features and computes     
  scores                                                                   
  2. Classification phase: DeepSeek identifies primary strengths/risks for 
  top and bottom deals                                                     
  3. Synthesis phase: Claude generates Slack-ready report with actionable  
  insights

  Test lead scoring v1 against Imubit workspace. Run the scoreLeads compute
   function and show me:                                                   
  1. Total deals scored                                                    
  2. Score distribution by grade (A/B/C/D/F)                               
  3. Top 5 highest scoring deals with their score breakdowns               
  4. Bottom 5 lowest scoring deals                                         
  5. Which custom fields contributed to scores (if any loaded from         
  discovery)

  - The scoring engine runs without errors                                 
  - Scores are distributed across the 0-100 range with proper letter grades
  - Score breakdowns show which features contributed points                
  - Custom field weights are loading and being applied from your discovery 
  results
