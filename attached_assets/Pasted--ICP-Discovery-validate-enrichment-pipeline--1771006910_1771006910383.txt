 ICP Discovery (validate enrichment pipeline)               
                                                                       
  Pros:                                                                
  - Shows the full enrichment pipeline end-to-end                      
  - Real customer ICP output you can show                              
  - Validates contact role resolution, custom field discovery,         
  conversation integration                                             
  - Strategic value (informs targeting, messaging, product roadmap)    
                                                                       
  What to test:                                                        
  1. Run on real customer data with at least 30 closed deals           
  2. Verify contact roles are resolved correctly                       
  3. Check persona clustering quality                                  
  4. If conversation data available, validate conversation intelligence
   tier                                                                
  5. Export the ICP report - this is a real deliverable you can show   
                                                                       
  ---                                                                  
  My Honest Recommendation                                             
                                                                       
  Do ICP Discovery first because:                                      
  1. It validates your entire enrichment pipeline (contact roles,      
  custom fields, conversations)                                        
  2. You get a real ICP report you can show to stakeholders            
  3. It's more impressive as a demo - "Here's who you actually sell to 
  successfully"                                                        
  4. Rep Scorecard is easier to test later (just needs deals + quotas) 
                                                                       
  Time estimate:                                                       
  - ICP Discovery: 2-3 hours (run on real data, validate output,       
  iterate on findings)                                                 
  - Rep Scorecard: 1-2 hours (verify graceful degradation, test        
  coaching classifications)
