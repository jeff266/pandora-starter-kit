Here are the investigation findings on Gong user       
  configuration:                                         
                                                         
  How it works:                                          
  - Tracked users are stored in                          
  connections.metadata.tracked_users (JSONB array) for   
  each workspace                                         
  - The sync requires at least one tracked user — if none
   are configured, it skips and logs a warning           
  - Each sync call passes the user's source_id as        
  primaryUserId to Gong's /calls/extensive endpoint,     
  filtering calls at the API level                       
                                                         
  How to update tracked users:                           
  The API endpoint exists: POST /api/workspaces/:workspac
  eId/connectors/gong/users/track                        
  Body: { user_ids: ["gong_user_id_1", "gong_user_id_2"] 
  }                                                      
                                                         
  The UI gap:                                            
  The Connectors page currently shows the Gong card as   
  "Healthy / 44 conversations / Sync Now" — but there's  
  no visible button to edit the tracked users list from  
  that view. User selection was likely done during the   
  initial connection flow and isn't re-surfaced once the 
  connector is in a healthy state.                       
                                                         
  To check which users are currently tracked, you'd query
   the DB directly:                                      
  SELECT metadata->'tracked_users' FROM connections      
  WHERE workspace_id = '<your_workspace_id>' AND         
  connector_name = 'gong';                               
                                                         
  Or hit the Gong users list endpoint to see available   
  users vs. tracked users.                               
                                                         
  Do you want me to add an "Edit Users" button to the    
  Gong connector card on the Connectors page so the      
  tracked user list can be updated without going through 
  the initial setup flow again?
