Replit made a commit after I pushed. On Replit, check if the    
  file actually exists:                                           
                                                                  
  # Check if file exists                                          
  ls -la server/skills/library/                                   
                                                                  
  # If single-thread-alert.ts is missing, you need to merge       
  git log --oneline --graph --all -5                              
                                                                  
  # Merge the GitHub changes properly                             
  git pull origin main --no-rebase                                
                                                                  
  If that shows a merge conflict or the file is missing:          
                                                                  
  # Get back to the GitHub state                                  
  git fetch origin                                                
  git checkout 3af4f59  # The single-thread-alert commit          
  ls server/skills/library/single-thread-alert.ts  # Should exist 
  now                                                             
                                                                  
  # Then go back to main and merge properly                       
  git checkout main                                               
  git merge 3af4f59                                               
                                                                  
  Most likely: Replit's commit a648ac4 was made on a different    
  branch or the file is there but the server just needs           
  restarting.                                                     
                                                                  
  Quick test - does this work?                                    
  cat server/skills/library/single-thread-alert.ts | head -5      
                                                                  
  If that shows the file, then it exists and you just need to     
  restart the Node.js server. If it says "No such file", then we  
  have a git issue to fix.                                        
                                                                  
  What does ls server/skills/library/ show?

⏺ The file exists! (6775 bytes, right there in the directory)     
                                                                  
  The problem is just that the Node.js server hasn't restarted to 
  reload the registry. The skill module is cached in memory.      
                                                                  
  On Replit, restart your server:                                 
                                                                  
  1. In the Console tab: Press Ctrl+C to stop the server          
  2. Click the green "Run" button to start it again               
  3. Watch for: [Skills] Registered all built-in skills           
                                                                  
  Then verify it worked:                                          
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces | head -20            
  # Copy a workspace ID from the response                         
                                                                  
  curl                                                            
  http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces/YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID/skills   
  # Should now show all 4 skills including "single-thread-alert"  
                                                                  
  Then run the skill:                                             
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces/YOUR_WORKSPACE
  _ID/skills/single-thread-alert/run \                            
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \                         
    -d '{}'                                                       
                                                                  
  The file is there (I can see it: single-thread-alert.ts in the  
  listing). You just need to restart the Node server so it loads  
  the new skill from disk into the registry. That's the only      
  missing step!
