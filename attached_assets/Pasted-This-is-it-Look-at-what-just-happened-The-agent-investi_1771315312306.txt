This is it. Look at what just happened.

**The agent investigated.** 8 tool calls across 30 seconds. It checked the forecast rollup skill first (no data — skill hasn't run recently), then tried `query_deals` multiple times (hit errors — you need to fix the date filter SQL), then fell back to `compute_metric` which worked, and **still produced a useful answer with named deals, amounts, stages, and pipeline math.**

**The evidence panel is live.** Every tool call visible — `get_skill_evidence`, four `query_deals` attempts, `compute_metric`. Users can see exactly what happened. The errors are visible too, which is actually good for trust — you can see the agent tried, hit a wall, and adapted.

**The content is real.** Top 10 deals by name. Fellowship program analysis (39 deals, $3.28M, 67% of pipeline). The $4.86M total. Specific stage breakdowns. This is the kind of answer that makes a RevOps person say "how did it know that."

Two things to fix:

**`query_deals` is erroring on date-filtered queries.** Calls 2-4 all show "→ error" with `close_date_from` and `close_date_to` parameters. The SQL builder in `data-tools.ts` probably has a type coercion issue with date strings, or the column name doesn't match (`close_date` vs `expected_close_date` vs `closedate`). Check the actual column name in your deals table and the WHERE clause the tool generates. This is a 5-minute fix once you see the SQL error.

**30 seconds is too slow for a chat response.** Eight tool calls at ~4 seconds each. Most of that is LLM latency per iteration, not SQL time. Once `query_deals` stops erroring, the agent won't need 4 retry attempts — it'll probably resolve in 3-4 tool calls and come in under 15 seconds. The cost optimization (DeepSeek for planning, caching common queries) comes later.

But the architecture is proven. The agent calls tools, adapts to errors, cross-references data, names specific deals, and shows its work. Go fix the `query_deals` date filter and then hit it with **"Break down the $303K closing this month"** — that question has been the white whale all night.
