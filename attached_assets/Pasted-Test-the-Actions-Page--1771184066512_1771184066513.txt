  What to verify:                                          
                                                           
  1. Summary Cards Row (top of page)                       
    - Shows 4 cards: Open Actions, Total Impact, Reps with 
  Actions, Executed This Week                              
    - Numbers should load (even if 0)                      
  2. Filter Bar                                            
    - Severity toggles: act (red), watch (yellow), notable 
  (purple), info (blue)                                    
    - Dropdowns for Status, Type, Rep, Skill               
    - Sort buttons work                                    
  3. Actions Queue Table                                   
    - 8 columns visible                                    
    - Left border color matches severity                   
    - Rows are clickable                                   
    - If no actions exist, should show empty state         
  4. Sidebar Navigation                                    
    - "Actions" appears after "Command Center"             
    - Badge shows count of critical actions (if any exist) 
    - Clicking navigates to /actions                       
  5. API Endpoints (check browser console)                 
    - No errors from                                       
  /api/workspaces/:id/action-items/summary                 
    - No errors from /api/workspaces/:id/action-items      
                                                           
  Expected behavior if no actions exist yet:               
  - Summary cards show 0s                                  
  - Table shows empty state message                        
  - No errors in console                                   
                                                           
  The Actions Engine backend was already merged, so the    
  endpoints should exist even if there's no data yet.      
  Actions will be created when skills run and emit the     
  <actions> blocks!
