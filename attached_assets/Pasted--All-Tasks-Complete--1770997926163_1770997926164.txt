  ✅ Task 1: Encryption service with "enc:" prefix     
  ✅ Task 2: Credential access layer                   
  (credential-store.ts)                                
  ✅ Task 3: Migration script enhanced                 
  ✅ Task 4: All credential consumers migrated         
  ✅ Task 5: .env.example already documented           
  ✅ Task 6: API response safety verified              
  ✅ Task 7: Test suite created (15 tests, all passing)
                                                       
  Security Benefits:                                   
                                                       
  - 🔒 AES-256-GCM encryption with random IVs          
  - 🔒 Tamper detection via authentication tags        
  - 🔒 Zero-downtime migration support                 
  - 🔒 No API endpoints expose raw credentials         
  - 🔒 Single source of truth for credential operations
  - 🔒 Future key rotation ready                       
                                                       
  The encryption infrastructure is now fully           
  implemented and all code has been centralized through
   credential-store.ts!
