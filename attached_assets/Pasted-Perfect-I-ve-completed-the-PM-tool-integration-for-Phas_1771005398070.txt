Perfect! I've completed the PM tool integration for  
  Phase 1 tasks 4-7. Here's what was implemented:      
                                                       
  Completed Work                                       
                                                       
  1. Action Types (Task #48) ✅                        
                                                       
  Created server/actions/types.ts with:                
  - ActionType enum including 8 ops-facing action types
   (ops_process_fix, ops_system_config,                
  ops_data_cleanup, etc.)                              
  - isOpsAction() helper to check if action routes to  
  PM tool                                              
  - actionTypeToOpsCategory() to map action types to   
  OpsCategory                                          
                                                       
  2. PM Task Service (Task #50) ✅                     
                                                       
  Created server/services/pm-task-service.ts with:     
  - createPMTask() function that reads PM connector    
  config from workspace settings                       
  - Gets credentials from credential-store as          
  pm_{connectorType}                                   
  - Enriches work items with defaults (projectId,      
  sectionId, labels)                                   
  - Routes to appropriate PM adapter (Monday.com       
  implemented)                                         
  - Stores task references in pm_task_references table 
                                                       
  3. PM Action Helpers (Task #51) ✅                   
                                                       
  Created server/skills/pm-actions.ts with:            
  - generateDataQualityWorkItems() to convert data     
  quality findings to PM tasks                         
  - Severity-based priority mapping (critical → 7 days,
   moderate → 14 days)                                 
  - Recommended fix → OpsCategory mapping              
  - Rich task descriptions with impact metrics and     
  field-specific explanations                          
                                                       
  4. Skill Integration (Task #51) ✅                   
                                                       
  Enhanced server/skills/webhook.ts to:                
  - Automatically generate PM tasks when               
  data-quality-audit skill completes                   
  - Extract field-level findings from quality_metrics  
  output                                               
  - Create tasks for critical fields with <90% fill    
  rate                                                 
  - Determine recommended fix based on field type and  
  severity                                             
                                                       
  5. Database Migration ✅                             
                                                       
  Created server/migrations/021_pm_task_references.sql:
  - pm_task_references table to track PM tool tasks    
  - Indexes on workspace_id, source_action_id,         
  connector_type                                       
  - UNIQUE constraint for deduplication                
                                                       
  Next Steps (Task #52 - Ready for Replit Testing)     
                                                       
  To test end-to-end in Replit:                        
                                                       
  1. Configure PM Connector in workspace settings:     
  {                                                    
    "pm_connector": {                                  
      "enabled": true,                                 
      "connectorType": "monday",                       
      "defaultProjectId": "<board_id>",                
      "defaultSectionId": "<group_id>",                
      "labels": ["pandora-generated"]                  
    }                                                  
  }                                                    
                                                       
  2. Store Monday.com API Key in credential store:     
  await storeConnectorCredentials(workspaceId,         
  'pm_monday', { apiKey: '<api_key>' });               
                                                       
  3. Run Migration:                                    
  psql $DATABASE_URL -f                                
  server/migrations/021_pm_task_references.sql         
                                                       
  4. Trigger Data Quality Audit:                       
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/skill
  s/data-quality-audit/trigger \                       
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \              
    -d '{"workspaceId": "<workspace_id>"}'             
                                                       
  5. Verify Tasks Created in Monday.com board and check
   pm_task_references table                            
                                                       
  All code is committed and pushed to GitHub (commit
