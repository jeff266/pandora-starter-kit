RUN TIER 1 SKILLS AGAINST SALESFORCE DATA

The Imubit workspace has 54 Salesforce opportunities synced with 
computed fields already calculated. Run the existing Tier 1 skills 
against this workspace to validate cross-CRM normalization.

1. IDENTIFY THE IMUBIT WORKSPACE ID

Query the database:
  SELECT id, name FROM workspaces WHERE name ILIKE '%imubit%';

You need the workspace_id for all skill runs below.

2. RUN EACH SKILL

Trigger via the existing skill execution endpoint:

a. Pipeline Hygiene
   POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/skills/pipeline-hygiene/run

b. Single-Thread Alert  
   POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/skills/single-thread-alert/run

c. Data Quality Audit
   POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/skills/data-quality-audit/run

d. Pipeline Coverage by Rep
   POST /api/workspaces/:workspaceId/skills/pipeline-coverage-by-rep/run

3. FOR EACH SKILL, VERIFY:

- Skill completes without errors
- Output references actual Salesforce deal names (not HubSpot data)
- Stage names are properly normalized (Salesforce stages like 
  "Closed Won", "04 - Proposal & Commercial Validation" should 
  map correctly to universal stages)
- Dollar amounts are populated (not null/zero)
- Duration and token usage are logged

4. LOG RESULTS

For each skill, capture:
- Status: PASS or FAIL
- Duration (ms)
- Number of deals analyzed
- Any errors or warnings
- Sample output (first 500 chars of the formatted result)

5. LIKELY ISSUES TO WATCH FOR:

- Stage normalization gaps: Salesforce custom stages that don't map 
  to any universal stage — the skill should handle these gracefully, 
  not crash
- Null amounts: Salesforce allows null Amount on Opportunities — 
  skills should skip or flag these, not divide-by-zero
- Small dataset (54 opps): Some skills may produce thin results. 
  That's fine — we're testing that they RUN, not that the insights 
  are deep
- Contact-to-deal associations: Single-Thread Alert needs contacts 
  linked to deals. If OpportunityContactRole wasn't synced, the skill 
  may flag everything as single-threaded. Note whether this is a 
  real finding or a data gap.
- Owner/rep names: Verify Salesforce owner names appear correctly 
  in Pipeline Coverage by Rep output

6. IF A SKILL FAILS:

Don't fix it yet. Log the error with full stack trace and move to 
the next skill. We want a complete picture of what works and what 
doesn't before making changes.

Run all four skills and report results.
