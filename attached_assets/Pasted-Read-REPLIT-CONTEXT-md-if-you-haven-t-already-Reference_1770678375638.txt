Port both conversation connectors:

server/connectors/gong/client.ts
- Port the extracted Gong client
- Add workspace_id throughout
- Replace storage calls with database calls

server/connectors/gong/transform.ts
- transformGongCall(gongCall, workspaceId) → normalized Conversation record
- Map: speakers → participants, transcript → transcript_text
- Extract: topics, sentiment, competitor mentions from transcript via Claude
  (or leave as TODO for now — raw transcript storage is fine for Phase 1)

server/connectors/fireflies/client.ts
- Port the extracted Fireflies client
- PRESERVE the exponential backoff retry logic — this is battle-tested
- PRESERVE the speaker consolidation logic
- Add workspace_id throughout

server/connectors/fireflies/transform.ts
- transformFirefliesCall(ffCall, workspaceId) → normalized Conversation record
- Map AI-generated summaries to our summary field
- Map action items to our action_items jsonb

For BOTH connectors, implement the PandoraConnector interface:
- connect(credentials, workspaceId)
- initialSync: pull all calls within a lookback period (default: 90 days)
- incrementalSync: pull calls since lastSyncAt
- health: check connection status

Add API routes:
- POST /api/workspaces/:id/connectors/gong/connect
- POST /api/workspaces/:id/connectors/gong/sync
- POST /api/workspaces/:id/connectors/fireflies/connect
- POST /api/workspaces/:id/connectors/fireflies/sync

EDGE CASES from READMEs:
- Gong: Basic auth (base64 encoded), NOT Bearer token
- Gong: Speaker attribution requires matching email to known contacts
- Fireflies: GraphQL API, NOT REST
- Fireflies: 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s), abort after 3 consecutive errors
- Fireflies: Speakers may have multiple display names — consolidation logic handles this
