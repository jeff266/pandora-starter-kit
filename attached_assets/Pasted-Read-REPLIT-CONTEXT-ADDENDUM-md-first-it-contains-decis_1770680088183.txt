Read REPLIT_CONTEXT_ADDENDUM.md first — it contains decisions that override parts of REPLIT_CONTEXT.md. Then read REPLIT_CONTEXT.md and ARCHITECTURE.md. These are the source of truth for this project.

Reference files:
- pandora-starter-kit/connectors/monday/README.md
- pandora-starter-kit/connectors/monday/copilot-source.ts (the original Monday adapter from Copilot)
- pandora-starter-kit/connectors/asana/README.md (partial — fetchTasks not implemented)
- pandora-starter-kit/connectors/google-drive/client.ts
- pandora-starter-kit/connectors/google-drive/README.md

Port Monday.com:

server/connectors/monday/client.ts
- Port from pandora-starter-kit/connectors/monday/copilot-source.ts
- Port the GraphQL queries, board/group/item management
- PRESERVE status label mapping logic (must match board's exact labels)
- Add workspace_id throughout
- Replace db.query.clientIntegrations with our pg-based credential lookup from connector_configs
- Implement BOTH read (fetchTasks) and write (createTask, updateTask)

server/connectors/monday/transform.ts
- transformMondayItem(item, workspaceId) → normalized Task record
- Map status labels to normalized: open, in_progress, blocked, completed

Port Google Drive:

server/connectors/google-drive/client.ts
- Port from starter kit
- OAuth token refresh logic
- MIME type handling (Docs→text, Sheets→CSV, text→raw)

server/connectors/google-drive/transform.ts
- transformDriveFile(file, workspaceId) → normalized Document record
- Auto-detect doc_type from filename and mime_type
- content_text populated from extracted text

Skip Asana for now — it's incomplete in Copilot (fetchTasks not implemented).
We'll build it fresh when needed. Monday.com covers the task management use case.

Add API routes for both connectors following the same pattern as HubSpot and Gong.

EDGE CASES:
- Monday: API key goes in Authorization header raw (NOT "Bearer {key}")
- Monday: GraphQL API, queries structured differently from REST
- Monday: Status labels are board-specific — "Working on it" vs "In Progress" etc.
- Google Drive: Access tokens expire after ~1 hour, must check before each request
- Google Drive: Google Docs/Sheets use export endpoint, regular files use download endpoint
