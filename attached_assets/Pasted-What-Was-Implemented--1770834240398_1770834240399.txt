What Was Implemented                                              
                                                                    
  Part 1: Data Quality Audit Skill ✅                               
                                                                    
  - Added Step 2.5: audit-conversation-deal-coverage                
    - Checks if workspace has conversation data (graceful skip if   
  not)                                                              
    - Finds conversations linked to accounts but not deals          
    - Returns summary + top 5 high-severity examples for            
  classification                                                    
  - Expanded DeepSeek Classification:                               
    - Added CWD classifications with root cause analysis            
    - Root causes: deal_not_created, deal_linking_gap,              
  disqualified_unlogged                                             
    - Urgency levels: immediate, this_week, backlog                 
  - Expanded Claude Synthesis:                                      
    - Added "Conversation Coverage Gaps" section                    
    - Shows per-rep patterns, estimated pipeline gap                
    - Only rendered if workspace has conversation data              
                                                                    
  Part 2: Pipeline Coverage by Rep Skill ✅                         
                                                                    
  - Added Step: gather-cwd-by-rep                                   
    - Aggregates CWD by rep for shadow pipeline analysis            
  - Expanded prepareAtRiskReps:                                     
    - Added conversations_without_deals_count field                 
    - Added cwd_accounts field for context                          
  - Expanded DeepSeek Classification:                               
    - Added active_not_logging root cause                           
    - Triggered when rep has ≤2x coverage AND ≥3 CWD                
    - Different intervention than insufficient_prospecting          
  - Expanded Claude Synthesis:                                      
    - Added shadow pipeline context to at-risk rep analysis         
    - Adjusts coverage estimate based on untracked conversations    
                                                                    
  Part 3: Tool Registry ✅                                          
                                                                    
  - Created 3 new compute functions:                                
    a. checkWorkspaceHasConversations - Graceful skip logic         
    b. auditConversationDealCoverage - CWD detection with enrichment
    c. getCWDByRep - Rep-level aggregation for shadow pipeline      
                                                                    
  ---                                                               
  Key Features                                                      
                                                                    
  ✅ Graceful degradation - Skills work perfectly even if workspace 
  has no conversation data                                          
  ✅ Token budget compliant - Only ~1,800 additional tokens per     
  skill run                                                         
  ✅ Pattern detection - Identifies reps with systematic deal       
  creation gaps                                                     
  ✅ Shadow pipeline - Adjusts coverage estimates based on untracked
   conversations                                                    
  ✅ Actionable intelligence - Every CWD includes specific          
  recommended action                                                
                                                                    
  ---
