First)
Three instances of the same unicode rendering bug:

Command Center — Pipeline by Stage subtitle shows literal \u00B7 instead of · (middot)
Deals page — Health column shows literal \u2014 instead of — (em dash)
Deals page — Findings column shows literal \u2014 instead of — (em dash)
These are all the same root cause — unicode escapes in string literals not being rendered. Likely a template or constant file where these characters are defined as escape sequences instead of actual Unicode characters. Do a global search for \u00B7 and \u2014 in the frontend code and replace with the actual characters · and —.

Also while you're on the Deals page: it needs a Pipeline filter dropdown alongside Stage, Owner, Health, and Status. Same ask as the Command Center pipeline selector — this is critical for multi-pipeline orgs.

Feature request: Add a "View in CRM" link/button for deals across the UI. The deep-link URLs are deterministic:

HubSpot: https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/{portalId}/deal/{source_id}
Salesforce: https://{instance}.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/{source_id}/view
The source_id on each deal is the CRM record ID. The portal ID (HubSpot) or instance URL (Salesforce) should be stored on the connector config or fetchable from it.

Places to add it:

Insights Feed — small external link icon next to each finding's deal name
Deals list — icon in the row or on the deal name link
Deal dossier/detail page — prominent "Open in HubSpot/Salesforce" button in the header
Opens in a new tab. Show the CRM logo (HubSpot sprocket or Salesforce cloud) as the icon so users instantly know where it goes. For file-imported deals with no CRM connection, don't show the button.



Third) 



Command Center shows {"error":"Authentication required"} in red on Pipeline by Stage and Active Findings sections on initial load. Clicking Retry loads the data fine. This is a race condition — the page is firing API requests before the auth session is ready.

This is not acceptable for production. Fix options:

Best: Don't render data sections until auth is confirmed. Show skeleton/loading states until the auth context is ready, then fire the API calls.
Alternative: Add automatic retry with backoff on 401 responses (retry once after 500ms before showing error state). The user should never see an auth error on a page they're already logged into.
Option 1 is the right fix. The page should gate data fetching on auth readiness, not fire-and-hope.

Also one more unicode bug: Active Findings section shows View all \u2192 instead of View all →. Same global search-and-replace fix as the others.
