Done! I've successfully fixed all invalid stage value references across  
  the codebase and pushed to GitHub.                                       
                                                                           
  Fixed Issues:                                                            
                                                                           
  1. Invalid 'open' stage in documentation                                 
                                                                           
  File: server/skills/tool-definitions.ts:93                               
  - Before: "Filter by normalized stage (open, closed_won, closed_lost)"   
  - After: "Filter by normalized stage (awareness, qualification,          
  evaluation, decision, negotiation, closed_won, closed_lost)"             
                                                                           
  2. Invalid 'proposal' stage in critical deals logic                      
                                                                           
  File: server/analysis/aggregations.ts:573                                
  - Before: const criticalStages = ['evaluation', 'decision', 'proposal',  
  'negotiation'];                                                          
  - After: const criticalStages = ['evaluation', 'decision',               
  'negotiation'];                                                          
                                                                           
  3. Invalid 'proposal' stage in AI prompt                                 
                                                                           
  File: server/skills/library/single-thread-alert.ts:75                    
  - Before: "Critical stages: evaluation, decision, proposal, negotiation" 
  - After: "Critical stages: evaluation, decision, negotiation"            
                                                                           
  Valid Normalized Stage Values:                                           
                                                                           
  - awareness                                                              
  - qualification                                                          
  - evaluation                                                             
  - decision                                                               
  - negotiation (from HubSpot connector)                                   
  - closed_won                                                             
  - closed_lost                                                            
                                                                           
  What This Fixes:                                                         
                                                                           
  - Skills that were filtering for "open deals" using invalid stage values 
  will now work correctly                                                  
  - The criticalStages filter in Single-Thread Alert will correctly        
  identify late-stage deals                                                
  - AI tools that query deals will receive accurate documentation about    
  valid stage values                                                       
                                                                           
  Note: "Open deals" are correctly identified throughout the codebase      
  using: stage_normalized NOT IN ('closed_won', 'closed_lost') or by       
  explicitly listing the open stages.
