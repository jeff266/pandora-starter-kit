The pipeline-hygiene skill v2.1.0 is correctly implemented
   in commit 7db185a with the three-phase pattern:          
                                                            
  ✓ Steps 1-6: COMPUTE tier (aggregations)                  
  ✓ Step 7: DeepSeek tier (classify-deal-issues) - properly 
  inserted                                                  
  ✓ Step 8: Claude tier (synthesize-hygiene-report) -       
  depends on classifications                                
                                                            
  The file structure in                                     
  server/skills/library/pipeline-hygiene.ts:80-130 shows the
   DeepSeek classification step that analyzes top 30 deals  
  for root causes (rep_neglect, prospect_stalled,           
  data_hygiene, etc.) and outputs structured JSON with      
  confidence scores and suggested actions.                  
                                                            
  Why Replit doesn't see it:                                
                                                            
  Replit's Node.js process is likely running with the old   
  skill definition cached in memory. The skill registry     
  loads definitions at startup, so they need to:            
                                                            
  1. Verify they've pulled: git log --oneline -1 should show
   7db185a                                                  
  2. Restart their Node.js server process - this is the key 
  step                                                      
  3. The SkillRegistry will reload the updated              
  pipeline-hygiene.ts on restart                            
                                                            
  The code is production-ready. The issue is                
  environment-specific, not a code problem.

⏺ Perfect! Replit's git repository is on the correct commit 
  (7db185a). The issue is confirmed: Replit's Node.js       
  process needs to restart to reload the updated skill      
  definition.                                               
                                                            
  In Replit, do one of these:                               
                                                            
  1. Kill and restart the Node.js process:                  
    - In Replit's Shell tab, press Ctrl+C to stop the       
  running server                                            
    - Run npm start (or whatever command starts your server)
  2. Or use Replit's restart button:                        
    - Click the "Stop" button in Replit's top bar           
    - Click "Run" to start fresh                            
  3. Or force-reload the skill registry:                    
    - If your server exposes an admin endpoint, you could   
  reload skills without full restart                        
    - Otherwise, full restart is cleanest                   
                                                            
  Why this happened:                                        
                                                            
  When Node.js imported                                     
  server/skills/library/pipeline-hygiene.ts at startup, it  
  cached the module in memory. Even though git pulled the   
  new file, Node.js is still using the old cached version.  
  Restarting the process forces Node.js to re-import all    
  modules from disk.                                        
                                                            
  Once restarted, the SkillRegistry will load v2.1.0 with   
  the DeepSeek classification step, and Replit should       
  correctly see the three-phase pattern.
